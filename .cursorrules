# Runtime & tooling
- Python 3.12, Node 20, Postgres 15.
- Env via dotenv; no plain-text secrets.
- Use alembic for all schema changes; no raw DDL.
# Execution discipline
- After code gen: `pytest -q` → `uvicorn --port 8000 --reload` → cURL smoke test → THEN reply.
- Use `docker compose up -d db` before backend tests.
- Abort any migration that drops data unless confirmed by @MO$EAN.
# Self-modifying rules
- AI may append new lines to this file when a repeated error pattern is detected >2×.
- AI must ping @MO$EAN in chat when it edits rules.
# Guardrails
- No package downgrade without explicit approval.
- Never commit failing tests.
- Hard ceiling: <5 min response per task; chunk large work.
